VO₂max Data Processing Recommendations (from PMC10687136, Table 4):

- Metabolic cart: State the exact device model and manufacturer.
- Measurement mode: State the measurement mode (e.g., mixing chamber, breath-by-breath).
- Software: State the name and version of the software used for the data analysis.
- Preprocessing: State if and how data underwent any initial modification (e.g., filtering of outliers, interpolation).
- Processing strategy: State the exact data processing strategy used to determine the VO₂max (e.g., binned time average).
